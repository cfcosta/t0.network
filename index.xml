      <description>Tier0 is two things: an Open Source software company, and an Open Source Software Collective, both with a common goal to maintain and promote Open Source as a viable approach to software development.
To do so, we do two things:
 Support some selected Open Source projects, with both development time and money. Provide enterprise-level support and development for those projects.  </description>

      <title>What is public and what is not?</title>
      <link>http://example.org/about/what-is-public/</link>

      <guid>http://example.org/about/what-is-public/</guid>
      <description>Anything is considered &amp;ldquo;public&amp;rdquo; unless said otherwise. That includes, but it is not limited by:
 Organizational Structure Communication Channels Budgets and Transaction Lists (possibly anonymized). Data on management platforms, such as JIRA or Basecamp. Code.  In general, any form of private communication is done via private means (e-mails, direct messages), and anything with bigger reach is public.
&amp;ldquo;Public&amp;rdquo;, in those terms, means that the information can be found online on a website that does not require the creation of an account to view the data.</description>

      <description>Tier0 and all its associates are expected to follow the Contributor Covenant v1.4.
In addition, some other behaviors are considered unacceptable:
 Discrimination based on political alignment, such as publicly ask for removal of members for subscribing to certain political stances. Public targeting of other members of the community without going through the normal process.  We don&amp;rsquo;t have yet an email for reporting incidents, so for now if any happen contact someone on the core team.</description>
