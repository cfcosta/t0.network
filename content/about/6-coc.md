Tier0 and all its associates are expected to follow the [Contributor Covenant
v1.4](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.md).

In addition, some other behaviors are considered unacceptable:

- Discrimination based on political alignment, such as publicly ask for removal
  of members for subscribing to certain political stances.
- Public targeting of other members of the community without going through the
  normal process.

We don't have yet an email for reporting incidents, so for now if any happen
contact someone on the core team. The information is considered official until
the end of the incident. Then, if both parties agree, they will be made public.

If we have not announced anything about a particular case, it's because either
the incident is not yet finished or taken care of or the parties wish to keep
it private. We're not going to comment any case in which those conditions are
not met.
