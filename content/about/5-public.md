Anything is considered "public" unless said otherwise. That includes, but it is
not limited by:

- Organizational Structure
- Communication Channels
- Budgets and Transaction Lists (possibly anonymized).
- Data on management platforms, such as JIRA or Basecamp.
- Code.

In general, any form of private communication is done via private means
(e-mails, direct messages), and anything with bigger reach is public.

"Public", in those terms, means that the information can be found online on a
website that does not require the creation of an account to view the data. It
does not mean that anyone can edit or comment the content, just that they can
have read access.

### What is non-public?

Information can be considered "non public" in one of three cases:

- The information is legally considered private, or members of the foundation
  or company are legally bound to keep the information secret.
- Publicizing this information is harmful to the affected parties, inviting
  harassment or threats to their life or well-being.
- Private communication between members. Those are defined as any conversation
  or between members outside of public spaces, and include, but are not limited
  by: private message on Discord channels, e-mail conversations outside of
  mailing lists, direct messages on Twitter/Mastodon.

In both cases, the information is withhold, unless the affected parties decide
to make the information public. In those cases, it can be expected that not all
information is released, and that the agreements are going to remain private.

Those informations are considered non public:

- Client names and agreement terms.
- Code and information regarding any customized versions a client might require.
- Harassment and misbehaving claims.
- Salaries of individual members working at `t0.enterprise`. Their positions
  will still have public salaries, but their name will not be shown.

The only exception to all those rules are any kind of information that may
prove that a criminal offense happened. Those will first be taken to Legal,
which will help us decide what to do with the information, and until it is safe
to do so (which might be never), we will keep the information secret.

The leaking of information considered not public is considered an acceptable
reason for termination of any contracts. We consider that we must default to
transparency, but some information can not be made public, and we have to obey.

The two entities are separated, so while there's motivation for the foundation
to cater to the needs of the company, they will be independent and those
interests might not be the same. Those cases will be decided on a per-case
basis.
