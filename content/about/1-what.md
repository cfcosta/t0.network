Tier0 is two things: an Open Source software company, and an Open Source
Software Collective, both with a common goal to maintain and promote Open
Source as a viable approach to software development.

To do so, we do two things:

- Support some selected Open Source projects, with both development time and
  money.
- Provide enterprise-level support and development for those projects.
